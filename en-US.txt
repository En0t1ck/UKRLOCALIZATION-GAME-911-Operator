After you click on the icon, the search area will appear, divided into sectors. To solve the incident, you need to find an object. There are two possible ways to do that:\n\n<b>Automatic search</b> - send a unit to the incident icon. The unit will search for the object. After completing the required work, the object will appear on the map. It's a low-effort, but more time-consuming method.\n\n<b>Manual searching</b> - send a unit to one of the sectors. The unit will continue the search as long as it stays in the sector. There are two possible outcomes:\n\n1. The object wasn't found. In that case, the current sector will disappear and the \"Sector clear!\" message will appear. Send the unit to another sector.\n\n2. The object was found. The sectors will be replaced by a new icon. Assigned unit will automatically approach to solve the incident.",
